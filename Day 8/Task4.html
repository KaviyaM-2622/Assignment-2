    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines and software capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. AI systems can learn from data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and even communicate with humans in natural language. They are widely used in daily life, from voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to recommendation systems on Netflix and YouTube, and self-driving cars.</p>
