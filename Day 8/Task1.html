    <h2>About CSS</h2>

    <!--Inline CSS-->
    <p style="background-color: rgb(13, 255, 0);" class="internal external">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
        With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more.

    <p style="background-color: chocolate;" class="internal external">
        The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.

    <p style="background-color: brown;" class="internal external">
        The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
        However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
