            <p>Published on October 1, 2025.</p>
            <p>In today's busy world, it's easy to forget about taking care of ourselves. Self-care doesn't have to be expensive or complicated, it's about building small habits that nurture your mind, body, and soul.</p>

            <h2>1. Start Your Morning Mindfull</h2>
            <p>Instead of rushing to your phone, try a few minutes of deep breathing, journaling, or stretching to set a positive tone for your day.</p>

            <h2>2. Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <p>Carrying a reusable water bottle helps you remember to drink enough water throughout the day.</p>

            <h2>3. Nourish with Whole Foods</h2>
            <p>Opt for colorful fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to fuel your body with real energy.</p>

            <h2>4. Rest Well</h2>
            <p>Quality sleep is the foundation of wellness. Aim for 7-8 hours and create a calming night routine.</p>
